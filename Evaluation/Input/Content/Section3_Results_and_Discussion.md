The PBPK model for Warfarin, was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* Intravenous Bolus S-Warfarin (0.375 mg/kg) 
* Oral administration over fasted state (dosing range of Warfarin 7.5 mg to 30 mg (equivalent to 3.75 mg to 15 mg S-Warfarin)
* Oral administration over fed state of 25-26 mg Warfarin (equivalent to 12.5-13 mg of S-Warfarin)
* Oral administration over fasted state of R-warfarin (25 mg  (equivalent to 12.5 mg of R-Warfarin)).
