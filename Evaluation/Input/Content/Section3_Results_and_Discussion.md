The PBPK model for Warfarin, was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* Intravenous Bolus S-Warfarin (0.375 mg/kg) 
* Oral administration over Warfarin in the fasted state in a dosing range of 7.5 mg to 30 mg (equivalent to 3.75 mg to 15 mg S-Warfarin)
* Oral administration over Warfarin in the fed state in a dosing range 25-26 mg (equivalent to 12.5-13 mg of S-Warfarin)
* Oral administration over of 25 mg Warfarin in the fasted and fed state (equivalent to 12.5 mg of R-Warfarin).
