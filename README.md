# Warfarin-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of Warfarin. 

## Repository files
This repository contains:

- a PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file of the current whole-body PBPK model of warfarin
- static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model
  
The model was developed and evaluated for S-Warfarin and R-Warfarin using data from several clinical studies. 
For S-Warfarin, the model was developed and evaluated against IV administration (0.375 mg/kg) and oral administration (dosing range of Warfarin 7.5 mg to 30 mg in the fasted state (equivalent to 3.75 mg to 15 mg of S-Warfarin), and 25-26 mg in the fed state (equivalent to 12.5-13 mg of S-Warfarin)). 
For R-Warfarin, the model was developed and evaluated against oral administration (dosing range of Warfarin 25 mg in the fasted and fed state (equivalent to 12.5 mg of R-Warfarin)). 

The PK-Sim snapshot file contains simulations and the observed data of all clinical studies used for model development and evaluation. 

<b>Caveat: No experimental values were found for R-Warfarin metabolism, therefore, values were kept from the previous PK-Sim project </b><br>
